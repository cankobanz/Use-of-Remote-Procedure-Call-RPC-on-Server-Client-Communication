# Use-of-Remote-Procedure-Call-RPC-on-Server-Client-Communication
This is a school project from Operating Systems course where local procedure, remote procedure control (RPC), piping, forking, child and parent processes are used effectively.  In the project, a client is request some task to done and make remote procedure control to server. In the server side, main process forks and the child process executes unknown function called blackbox. Parent process send necessary input that come from client to child process through pipe and child process executes blackbox by using execl() function. Then, child sends back the results to the parent through another pipe. Lastly, server sends back the results to client and client process redirects stderr and stdout to some txt file to write the outputs.
